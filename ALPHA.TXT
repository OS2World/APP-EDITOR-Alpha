             Lionel de Lambert - Iunius MMDCCXLIII AUC

                IBM United Kingdom Laboratories Ltd.

                          06 August 1997






This document describes the installation, function and commands
of the ALPHA software analysis programme which runs under
the OS/2 v2.0 or later operating system. 

The languages supported are :-

370 and 386 assembler, PASCAL(Ada), PL/X(PL/I, REXX), C(C++), and
FORTRAN.


Description
===========
This is a simple 32-bit, configurable, multi-document, highlighting editor
version of the alpha software analysis programmes which were written
together with the CMS programme ANALYSE in order to establish the praecognita 
for the CICS restructure project and may be of interest to those people who
examine 370, 386 assembler, PASCAL(Ada), PL/X(PL/I, REXX), C(C++),
FORTRAN etc. under OS/2 V2.0 or later. 



This programme will provide basic browse and edit functions for all files
with arbitrarily long records, {records >= 256 will be split for display
and rejoined when saved} as well as highlighting specified
keywords for language files such as 370 & 386 Assemble, PASCAL,
PL/AS, C(CPP), FORTRAN etc. ALPHA will also display the programme
call structure, and expand the procedure calls in a secondary
window.

This version of Alpha was written in C-Set/2 and MASM V6.0 and will run
on OS/2 V2.0 or later.



Highlighting of keywords has been provided for the following
language types :-  A37,ASM,PAS,(PLS,PLX,PLI),(C,CPP,H),FOR,IPF.PRF
[Other languages may be defined].


The syntax of the Alpha programme is :-



   START ALPHA [file] [file] .. [/p [profile name - default ALPHA.PRF]]



The Extension, Case, CommentPos, Language, Comment, String, 
and TransferPgm(1) are the only ones which are recognised from the profile.
{The file name may contain a wild character, e.g. '*'.}



Installation
============
The minimum requirement is to copy the file ALPHA.EXE to a
directory under OS/2 v2.x. If you want to access the Extended
help you must copy the file ALPHA.HLP in to the HELP path. If
you wish to use the Alpha fonts you should copy the files
ALPHA.FON, 'ALPHAA__.AFM', 'ALPHAA__.PFB', and 'ALPHAA__.PFM'
to a directory under OS/2 v2.x and select 'System Setup'
from 'OS/2 System' and use 'Add' in the 'Edit font' of  the
'Font Palette'. If you wish to access files from the host then
you should also install a file transfer programme such as
ALMCOPY.

Menu  
====
The Allocate dialogue box is used to request a file to be read,
or create a new file. The Create button uses the contents of the Combo box
to set the default file name when creating a new file.    
The SetDir button will set the current directory from the Combo box.
If the drive letter is changed then the OK button should be used
to refresh the List boxes. A file may also be allocated by
dragging mouse button 2 with the Ctrl key pressed from a Drives
window and releasing it over the Alpha window. {The maximum
number of child windows is limited to the storage available.
If the file size is greater than 8Mbytes then a prompt will 
be issued to allow a part of the file to be read.}

The Transfer button will pass the contents of the Combo box to the
Transfer_pgm. 

The Command dialogue box(2) may be used to issue a search command
e.g.


Non-case sensitive search for a string.

Case sensitive search for a string.

Case sensitive search for a string in column one.
{Specify a pattern character (wild) e.g. 'TCT*EI' as  a search
 argument for a forward search and specify '*' in the 
 'Pattern Chr.' entry box.}

Set the search mode to backwards.

(The string search starts from the current cursor position +1.)

Move to a specified line number.

Replace the text at the current cursor position with the text from
     the Replacement Text Entry Box.

Replace all - repeat to end-of-file replacing the
     text at the current cursor position with the text from
     the Replacement Text Entry Box and locate the next string.

Options
=======
The Options menu may be used to set the following options :-

 Status bar - display the status bar at the base of the main window.

 Tab - expand the record by using X'09' characters to round to
       columns n*(Tab interval).
                        
 Line No. - display the line No. at the left of the record. 
 Keyword - highlight the keywords.

 Include - For the file types of MASM, PASCAL, PL/S {PL/I etc.}
        and C read the include files specified by :-

        include file_name, {$INCLUDE : 'file_name' }, %INCLUDE
        first_part_of_file_name;, #include <file_name>, respectively
        when expanding a call etc.

        {The current directory together with the paths defined by the
        INCLUDE environment variable will be searched. The total number
        of open files/windows is limited to the available storage
        so the include nesting level is limited to the storage of the
        machine.  For language 4, PL/S, the file extension is appended
        to the first_part_of_file_name.}

Grid - Draw vertical grid lines through every tenth character in
       the Grid colour and flag lines greater than 80 characters long. 
       Records greater than 256 characters, continued, will be flagged 
       with the highlight colour. 

Box - Switch the select mode to box format. In box mode the "Paste" function 
      will overwrite the text at the cursor position with the box area.
 
Tool bar - Display the "Tool bar"; which makes toggling of some options
         easy.

 - The Search argument Entry box specifies the search string, 
   the default is the highlight string.             
 - The Search directory Entry box specifies the current directory
   to be searched. This may be altered to set a new search directory.
 - The File type Entry box specifies the file extension, 
   the default is the first extension for the language of the last active 
   window or 'C'. The files searched are of the type 
   '*.file_extension' in the current directory.
 - If the Subdirectories check box 
   is checked then any directories below the current one
   will also be searched.
 - If the Case sensitive check box
   is checked then the string search will be case sensitive. 
 - The List box displays the found lines. If one is selected 
   and the GoTo button pressed then a child window will be created for
   the file from the current directory. 
 - The Locate button will search the current directory for the
   Argument string and fill the List box.        
 - The CpyClp button will copy the contents of the List box to the Clipboard.
 - The Cancel button will dismiss the Dialogue box.      
 - The Case sensitive Check box specifies whether the search is to be
   case sensitive or not.    

XREF
====
The XREF dialogue box may be used to search the records of the last active
window for a string. 
 - The Argument Entry box specifies the search string, 
   the default argument is the 'or' of the highlight strings.
   The argument may contain several strings separated by a blank,
   'ª' or '&'; where a blank implies 'or', 'ª' implies not this
   string and '&' is the logical and, e.g.
   "SUBRTINE_1 & ª call"
 - The List box displays the found lines. If one is selected 
   and the Go to button pressed then the last active child window will be 
   scrolled to that line.
 - The Locate button will search the last active child window's records for the
   Argument string and fill the List box.     
 - The CpyClp button will copy the contents of the list box to the Clipboard.
 - The Cancel button will dismiss the Dialogue box.      
 - The Case sensitive Check box specifies whether the search is to be
   case sensitive or not.   
 - The Search all children Check box causes all the data of the children 
   to be searched.
 - The Keyword Check box specifies whether the string should be terminated
   by a non-alphanumeric character. 
 - The Include records Check box indicates whether the argument string
   is used to include or exclude records.
 
 
Profile
=======
A profile(6) may be specified defining the following keyword
values, these are the only ones recognized by the Alpha programme:-

Extension, Case, CommentPos, Language, Comment, String, Keywords, 
Operator, Keys and TransferPgm.

Extension specifies the File types to be recognized. The string
must be <=128 characters and terminated by a comma.

There then follows sections of language definitions starting
with the file extension extension :- 

 [C]                            
 Case=Yes                    ;; The language is case sensitive   
 CommentPos=0                ;; 0, 1-n
 Language=C                  ;; FORTRAN, A37, ASM, C, none, default
 Comment="/*//*/  "          ;; start and end character pairs
 String="" ' " ' ",\         ;; start and end character pairs, escape chr.   
 Tab=10,16,40,72             ;; up to eight fixed tab positions 
 Keywords                    ;; The following is a list of keywords
 if,(GREEN,YELLOW,UNDERLINE) ;; sample keyword
 .END                        ;; End of list of keywords 

Case - specifies whether the language is case sensitive. If the language
is not case sensitive then the keywords should be specified in
upper case.

CommentPos - specifies the column position of the fixed comment or 0.

Language - specifies the language type and is one of :-
default  - Free format comment and strings etc. (Algol).
none     - No comment or string analysis to be performed.
A37      - 370 assembler.
ASM      - MASM 386 assembler.
C        - C language.
FORTRAN  - FORTRAN language.

Comment - two pairs of start characters followed by two pairs of end
          characters. A blank implies not used.
String  - two pairs of start characters followed by two pairs of end
          characters. A blank implies not used.                     
Tab     - specify up to eight fixed tab positions separated by commas.
          Further tab characters are interpreted as multiples of
          the Tab interval from the Preference page.
Keywords - Starts a list of keyword definitions terminated by '.END'.

 keyword,colour 

The colour may be a single colour or an expression viz. :-
  (<text_colour>,<background_colour>,<UNDERLINE>)
                   
The case and spaces within the keyword are significant,
{the first character is used for the initial scan so a space would
reduce the performance}.
The keywords must be <=128 characters.
{Colours may take the values :BLUE, DARKCYAN, BLACK, DARKBLUE,
DARKPINK, DARKGRAY, DARKRED, DARKGREEN, BROWN, CYAN, RED, GREEN
,PINK, YELLOW, PALEGRAY, DEFAULT, WHITE (ORANGE, PURPLE, PALEGREEN, 
PALEBLUE,PALEYELLOW,PALERED,COLOUR1,..,COLOUR8)}


Operator defines the operator keywords for each language.
The second value indicates how to process the keyword, viz.
< or > indicate the scan direction from the keyword to locate the label,
'P' or 'C' indicates that the keyword specifies an entry point or call,
':' indicates that the label will be followed by a colon,
'2' indicates that the second label following a ',' is to be used.
The entries may be defined as follows :-
file_type,<º>CºP[:][2],keyword
and are terminated by '.END', invalid entries are ignored.
The keywords must be <=128 characters. 

Keys specifies a list of functions which may be assigned
to alternate keyboard keys. The values may be 'Ctrl+a' or 'Ctrl+Shift+A'
where 'a' is a character. The list is terminated by '.END', e.g.
Keys                           ;; Accelerator keys
Backout=Ctrl+z                 ;; Backout
BoxLine=Ctrl+l                 ;; Toggle Box/Line mode select
Bracket=Ctrl+m                 ;; Match brackets
Calculator=Ctrl+k              ;; Invoke calculator
CommentSup=Ctrl+Shift+H        ;; Suppress comments
Compare=Ctrl+Shift+F           ;; Compare files
Compile=Ctrl+c                 ;; Compile
ConvertCase=Ctrl+u             ;; Convert to/from upper/lower case
DisAsm=Ctrl+d                  ;; Disassemble EXE & DLL
Edit=Ctrl+Shift+E              ;; Edit line
Expand=Ctrl+e                  ;; Expand label
Hex=Ctrl+h                     ;; Display original file in Hex
Highlight=Ctrl+i               ;; Highlight label under cursor
HighlightSup=Ctrl+y            ;; Suppress highlighted lines
LocateHigh=Ctrl+Shift+I        ;; Make locate argument of highlighted label
Playback=Ctrl+p                ;; Playback
Record=Ctrl+r                  ;; Record
SaveFile=Ctrl+Shift+S          ;; Save File
Search=Ctrl+g                  ;; Search directories
Structure=Ctrl+s               ;; Display structure
XREF=Ctrl+x                    ;; Search children for strings
.END                           ;;  

TransferPgm specifies the programme name invoked 
from the Allocate widow. The data from the COMBO box is passed
without modification to the TransferPgm when the Transfer button is
selected.

Tool bar
========
The Tool bar may be used to set an option etc. quickly.  
The following buttons are available :-

 - Hide/re-instate highlighted records from display.
 - Display/Create structure List box.
 - Toggle Line No. display.

 - suppress/display the comments in a language file.
   If a single line is scrolled then the comment suppression will be disabled.
 - Expand the highlighted label.
 - Save the file.
 - Compile file
 - Copy the selected records to the Clipboard and erase from from memory.
 - Overwrite the current line with records from the Clipboard.
 - Delete records from memory.

 - Select the next child and make it active.

 

If mouse button 2 is held down on a button then a small help
balloon will be displayed. The structure of the Tool bar may be modified
by using the "T" page of the Configure notebook. If the Tool bar is in the
menu then if button 2 is held down and moved to a new position the button 
will be moved.



Add/Modify a language
=====================
Alpha has within it (hard coded) routines which understand
certain language features e.g. 370 Assembler 
procedures are invoked by BAL, BAS etc.     
  

START ALPHA /p profile_name          


A sample profile (ALPHA.PRF) is provided in the package, which
includes comments explaining the use of the keywords. This may
be edited to change/add a file extension i.e.
by modifying the following keywords :-     

Extension - list of file extensions up to 128 characters         
             

Case - case sensitivity.
CommentPos - For Fixed comments
Comment - Comment delimiters
String - string delimiters and escape character
Language - language structure
Keywords - list of keyword definitions                   
i.e.                               
keyword,colour      

Operator - list of language operator values and
           attributes

file_type,attributes,keyword     

                                                                
                

e.g. to add language XYZ with a routine call 'ICALL
routine_name'  with similar structure to PL/S the profile would
include the following statements :-          

                                                                
                                                           
Extension="A37,ASM,PAS,XYZ,C,FOR,"                              
               
[XYZ]
Case=No
Language=default
CommentPos=0
String="" ' " ' "
Comment="/*  */  "
Keywords
ICALL,DARKGREEN                                          
Next_key ,RED                                            
.END   

Operator
XYZ,>C,ICALL
.END                     



The ALPHA programme scans the keyword table in the order
specified in the profile, so a later entry may replace a former
entry.



Writing a parser exit DLL
=========================
If the DLL, ALPHAE.DLL, has been provided in the LIBPATH then the procedure
Alpha_parse_exit will be called from the WM_PAINT child window procedure.
A sample source module ALPHAE.C is provided which may be used to create
a DLL with a parser exit procedure. This module may be used to write the records
to the child window.



Recent changes to the ALPHA package.
==================================== 

1) Separate threads to read Compiler output & search directory.                      
2) Improved bracket matching.
3) Adobe Type 1 fixed pitch font with hexadecimal and alphanumeric characters.
4) Ctrl+e/Shift+mouse button 2 now expand a label.
5) Set current directory from the search dialogue box.

Notes
=====
1 The data in the Allocate COMBO will be passed without
modification to the Transfer_pgm.

2 The COMBO box will hold the previous three search strings
entered.



3 The colours may take the values :BLUE, DARKCYAN, BLACK,
DARKBLUE, DARKPINK, DARKGRAY, DARKRED, DARKGREEN, BROWN, CYAN,
RED, GREEN ,PINK, YELLOW, PALEGRAY, DEFAULT, WHITE, 
ORANGE, PURPLE, PALEGREEN, PALEBLUE, PALEYELLOW, PALERED,
COLOUR1,..,COLOUR8.
{The last nine colours will not be available on VGA screens.
The COLOURn value may be set by the sliders and will be remembered
when the Enter button is pressed.}





4 If mouse button 1 is held down and moved to the bottom or top
of the window the window will continue to scroll until the
button is released or the mouse is moved back within the window.

5 The ALPHA2.HLP file must be installed in the HELP path.

6 A sample profile is supplied with the name ALPHA.PRF. This
file may be edited to alter the programme defaults. The profile
is read by specifying /p as a parameter to the programme. 



7 These keywords and attributes may be specified by the
Language_operator keyword in the profile.
